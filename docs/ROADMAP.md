# MeshSat Hub — Roadmap

**Updated:** 2026-03-19
**YouTrack:** Project `MESHSAT`, issues prefixed `MESHSAT-`

---

## Tri-Mode Architecture

MeshSat Hub is designed as a **3-tier deployment system**, selectable at startup via `HUB_MODE`:

```
Tier 1: STANDALONE           Tier 2: CLUSTER              Tier 3: KUBERNETES
(single node, edge)          (multi-host HA)              (cloud-native, auto-scale)

+----------+                 +----------+ +----------+   +---+ +---+ +---+
|   Hub    |                 |  Hub-NL  | |  Hub-GR  |   |Hub| |Hub| |Hub|
| (SQLite) |                 | (Galera)   (Galera)   |   +---+ +---+ +---+
|Mosquitto |                 |  NATS       NATS      |      |     |     |
+----------+                 +----------+ +----------+   +-MariaDB Galera+
                              + garbd +                  +----Redis-----+
                              (arbiter)                  +--NATS (x3)---+
```

| Tier | Mode | Store | Bus | Dedup/RL | Leader | Status |
|------|------|-------|-----|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `standalone` | SQLite | Mosquitto | In-memory | Noop | **Production** |
| 2 | `cluster` | Postgres | NATS+MQTT | Redis | NATS queues | Retired (the Galera compose stack left the DMZ hosts on 2026-09-08) |
| 3 | `kubernetes` | Postgres (CNPG) | NATS StatefulSet | Redis | k8s Lease API | **Production** (notrf01cl01k8s, MESHSAT-864) |

**Current production:** Tier 3 on notrf01cl01k8s (`k8s/`, Argo CD); MariaDB/Galera support was removed in MR 23.

### v1.0 — Production Hardening (Complete, 2026-03-18)

hawkBit OTA, built-in user management (Argon2id + JWT + refresh tokens), security headers (HSTS/CSP/CORS), OWASP testing, security MCP tools. Tech debt: MQTT reconnect fix, API handler tests, Swagger annotations, goroutine pool.

### Maintenance — 2026-08-21 (MESHSAT-710/711/712)

**MESHSAT-710 (fixed, commit ffdce80):** the shared Paho MQTT client keeps one callback per exact topic filter, so every later `Subscribe` on the same filter silently replaced the earlier handler. In production the SOS detector, position subscriber, MO message subscriber, and TAK SOS relay received nothing (routing engine and WebSocket bridge, the last subscribers, held the filters). `internal/bus/paho` now multiplexes same-filter subscriptions: one broker subscription per filter, fan-out dispatch to all handlers, QoS-upgrade resubscribe, reconnect replay. Verified end-to-end on both production nodes.

**MESHSAT-712 (fixed, commit 803c530):** CI lint pinned to golangci-lint v2.11.3 — `@latest` (v2.13.1+) requires Go 1.26 while the CI image is golang:1.25.

**MESHSAT-711 (open):** the routing engine runs on every cluster node, dispatching each matched route once per node (observed 2× SMS per message). Fix direction: leader-gate dispatch or shared subscriptions.

## Post-v1.0 Gap Analysis (2026-03-19 Audit)

A comprehensive code audit revealed that while all v0.1–v1.0 epics are closed, several features have **code that exists but is not wired into the runtime**, and several expected capabilities are **completely missing**.

### Built But Not Wired

| Feature | Package | Gap |
|---------|---------|-----|
| MO fragment reassembly | `internal/fragment/` | `Reassembler` complete but `SetReassembler()` never called in main.go |
| E2E encryption | `internal/crypto/` | AES-256-GCM + per-device keystore complete. Never instantiated. No API for key CRUD. RockBLOCK handler hardcodes `encrypted=false` |
| SOS trigger logic | `internal/escalation/` | Engine + tiers + notifiers all work. But nothing detects SOS messages or publishes to `meshsat/{imei}/sos` |
| Dead man's switch triggers | `internal/deadman/` | Monitor runs but integration with actual device heartbeats unclear |

### Completely Missing

| Feature | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| SMS gateway (inbound + outbound) | Can't reach operators without internet/app |
| PGP Email gateway (inbound + outbound) | No email channel for store-and-forward comms |
| OpenAPI spec generation (swagger.json) | No machine-readable API docs |
| Configurable message routing engine | Fanout is hardcoded MQTT subscriptions, not user-configurable rules |
| MeshSat Simulator / virtual modem | Can't develop or demo without hardware |
| IPoUGRS adapter (IP-over-satellite) | Experimental differentiator, not started |
| Tor device discovery | Field devices can't auto-discover Hub .onion address |
| WireGuard auto-provisioning | Devices don't get WG configs automatically on registration |

---

## v1.1 — Wire the Unwired (Next)

**Goal:** Complete the last-mile integration for features that are built but disconnected. After v1.1, every implemented feature is functional end-to-end.

**Priority:** HIGH — these are silent failures in production (fragments silently dropped, encrypted messages silently rejected, SOS silently ignored).

| Issue | Summary | Depends On | Est. |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| MESHSAT-168 | Wire MO fragment reassembly in main.go | — | 2h |
| MESHSAT-169 | Wire E2E encryption: instantiate keystore, decrypt in RockBLOCK handler, add key CRUD API | MESHSAT-168 | 6h |
| MESHSAT-170 | Implement SOS trigger: detect SOS in MO messages, publish to sos topic, fire escalation | — | 4h |
| MESHSAT-171 | Wire dead man's switch to device heartbeats from position/telemetry updates | MESHSAT-170 | 3h |
| MESHSAT-173 | OpenAPI spec generation with swaggo/swag + CI auto-generate | — | 4h |

**Acceptance:** All unit tests pass. Integration test for fragment reassembly + encrypted MO message. SOS trigger fires escalation chain in test. swagger.json served at /api/docs.

---

## v1.2 — Channel Completion — Complete (2026-04-04)

**Goal:** Add the missing communication channels that make Hub a complete multi-channel gateway.

| Issue | Summary | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| MESHSAT-174 | SMS gateway: outbound via Twilio/Vonage REST API, inbound via webhook receiver | Done |
| MESHSAT-175 | SMS escalation notifier: wire SMS gateway to escalation engine as Notifier | Done |
| MESHSAT-186 | PGP Email gateway: SMTP outbound + inbound webhook, auto PGP encrypt/decrypt, key management API + Vue UI | Done |
| MESHSAT-176 | WireGuard auto-provisioning: generate peer config on device registration, assign VPN IP | Done |
| MESHSAT-177 | Tor .onion address API: expose Hub's .onion in /api/tor/onion for device provisioning | Done |

**Acceptance:** All channels operational. SMS send+receive via Twilio. PGP email with auto-encryption and key management UI. WG config auto-generated on device creation. .onion address exposed via API.

---

## v1.3 — Routing Engine (After v1.2)

**Goal:** The killer feature — configurable any-to-any message routing with zero-config defaults.

| Issue | Summary | Depends On | Est. |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| MESHSAT-178 | Routing engine: per-tenant routing rules (source → destinations) with CRUD API | — | 12h |
| MESHSAT-179 | Default routes: zero-config fanout (satellite → TAK + APRS + webhook + notifications) | MESHSAT-178 | 4h |
| MESHSAT-180 | Routing UI: Vue view for creating/editing/testing routing rules | MESHSAT-178 | 8h |
| MESHSAT-181 | SMS as routing destination: integrate SMS gateway into routing engine | MESHSAT-174, MESHSAT-178 | 3h |
| — | Email as routing destination: integrate PGP email into routing engine | MESHSAT-186, MESHSAT-178 | 3h |

**Acceptance:** New tenant gets default routes that fan out to all enabled channels. Owner can add/remove/modify routes via UI. Any inbound message from any source reaches all configured destinations.

---

## v2.0 — Developer Experience (After v1.3)

**Goal:** Make Hub approachable for developers and the open-source community.

| Issue | Summary | Depends On | Est. |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| MESHSAT-182 | MeshSat Simulator: virtual Iridium modem, synthetic MO generator | — | 12h |
| MESHSAT-183 | IPoUGRS adapter: IP-over-Iridium tunnel (experimental, mark as alpha) | — | 16h |
| MESHSAT-184 | Developer onboarding: `make dev` starts Hub + Simulator + all deps, no hardware needed | MESHSAT-182 | 4h |
| MESHSAT-185 | Sensor payload framework: pluggable decoders (ZigBee, LoRa, Protobuf) with registration API | — | 8h |

**Acceptance:** `make dev` starts full stack with simulated devices. GitHub README has working quickstart. Sensor payloads decoded and routed.

## Security Track (Ongoing)

| Practice | Frequency |
|----------|-----------|
| gosec + govulncheck in CI | Every push |
| OWASP ZAP on production URLs | Every minor release |
| Dependency audit (CVE + license) | Every new dependency |
| readJSON() for all request bodies | Every new handler |
| Pre-deploy Galera health gate | Every deployment |

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Testing Matrix

| What | Where | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| Unit tests | CI (golang:1.25-alpine) | `go test ./...` — 28 packages |
| Integration tests | CI (embedded MQTT) | `go test -tags=integration` |
| E2E smoke tests | Post-deploy on live cluster | `test/e2e/smoke_test.sh` via `verify` CI stage |
| Playwright browser tests | Post-deploy | 37 tests across 4 categories |

### CI/CD Pipeline

```
lint -> security -> test -> build -> package (GHCR) -> deploy (AWX) -> verify (E2E) -> pages
```

### Production Hosts

| Host | Location | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| nllei01dmz01 | Netherlands | Hub-NL, Galera node 1, garbd, Redis, NATS |
| grskg01dmz01 | Greece | Hub-GR, Galera node 2, Redis, NATS |

### Deployment

Merge to `main`: CI builds and scans the image, `bump_k8s_pin` rewrites the digest in
`k8s/kustomization.yaml`, Argo CD rolls the Deployment on notrf01cl01k8s. The Galera/Ansible
path was retired on 2026-09-08 (MESHSAT-864).
